  },
  {
    question: "What should I prepare before my telemedicine appointment?",

    question: "Are telemedicine consultations as effective as in-person visits?",

  {
    question: "Is my medical information secure and confidential?",

  },
  {
    question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    answer: "We accept all major credit cards, debit cards, UPI, net banking, and health insurance. Payment is processed securely through our encrypted payment gateway."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I reschedule or cancel my appointment?",
    answer: "Yes, you can reschedule or cancel your appointment up to 2 hours before the scheduled time through your account dashboard or by contacting our support team."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I have technical issues during my consultation?",
    answer: "Our technical support team is available 24/7 to help you. You can also access troubleshooting guides in the help section or contact us via phone for immediate assistance."
